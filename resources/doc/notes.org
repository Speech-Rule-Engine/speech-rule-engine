** Potential xsd validators:
*** https://github.com/amouat/xsd-validator
    In Java
*** https://gist.github.com/iiska/215879
    In Python, seems to use etree library.

* TODO List for mathml integration

** [DONE] Parent attribute in outermost wrapped node should go to inner node.

** [DONE] Invisible operators.

*** Add them as a node. 
**** What about punctuation? Text punctuation?

*** Expose by specialised flag.

*** Add a specialised attribute.

** [DONE] Add collapsed attribute.

** Check what happens to explicit function applications.
   
** Look into prime inside a msubsup.

*** Currently this is not treated special.
*** However it is punctuation and role prime.
*** Should that be changed in semantic tree.
*** Is it "a one prime" or "a prime one"? According to mathspeak the latter.

** Add more tests!

** [DONE] Cleanup functions for walktree and special cases.

** [DONE] Add more tests!

** [DONE] Special case for MMultiscript
   
** [DONE] Build Semantic Tree unit separately.

** [DONE] Sort out ignored elements.

*** Should be retained in the tree.
    
*** Maybe clone all nodes deep and make replacement better (that can be expensive!).
    
*** Alternatively retain them somehow in the semantic tree.


* TODO In semantic tree: 
** Deal with pathological mrow cases. E.g.:
    '<math><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>'
    should be as single infix operation.
** in "int sum a dx" the dx is going to be put into the sum.
    '<math><msup><mo>\u222B</mo><mi>X</mi></msup><msub><mo>\u2211</mo><mi>Y</mi></msub><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></math>'
** Proper handling of role of inner function if propagated as explicit function.
**** currently it propagates simple function only.
**** overwrites the given role
** Fences are not properly matched sometimes. 
   In particular double close etc. are converted to punctuated.
   Reimplementation:
*** When only open and neutral left:
**** Split wrt. open
**** Try to combine neutral in the inbetween.
**** Leftover neutral (at beginning or end) are NOT transformed into punctuation.
**** Try to combine open and neutral afterwards. 
**** There might be a need to consider what is better to leave depending on outside open fence.
***** ( || | || |  etc.
**** Only what is then left is turned into punctuations.
*** When leading close
**** Try to combine as much as possible to the right.
**** Come back to open fence.
*** Generally consider leaving fences until processed and only then convert them to punctuation.
** Fences over relations and vice versa
** Test pages:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation
** Make use of MathJax's TEXCLASSes? NO

*** class="MJX-TeXAtom-OPEN"


* TODO For role computation: 
** DONE Tensor role.
** Punctuated with same punctuation does not seem to work.
** DONE Multiop for operations > 1

* TODO Embellished operators:
** DONE Full treatment of embellished operators.
** DONE Possibly introduce an embellished attribute.
*** DONE Set to give direction of embellishment.
*** DONE Inherit upwards for sub super tensor nodes.
** TODO Check for equality of multiple operators.


* DONE Embellished fences:
** DONE Simple treatment of some open, closed and neutral fences.
*** Use predicates to allow for treatment.
*** We allow for opening left and closing right embellishments.
*** Neutral fences can be matched only if left/right embellishment makes sense.
*** In case of multiply embellished fence, we make it into a punctuation.
*** That should be done in the tensor case!
** DONE Advanced treatment via extra attribute
*** Similar to embellished operators.

* TODO Add characters in region of 274E to 2760

* Stuff of entity problems:

** Could add this when creating DOMParser:
   {locator: { }, errorHandler: {warning: function(w) {},
   error: function(l, m) {console.log('non fatal');},
   fatalError: function(l, m) {console.log('fatal');}
   }});




* TODO Separate CQF function calls etc. clearly by rule set.
