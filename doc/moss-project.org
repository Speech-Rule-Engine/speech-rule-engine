* Constraint redesign 


** Purpose: to improve on the applicability tests

** Three types of constraints: Dynamic, Query, Boolean

** Changes for Dynamic Constraints:

*** Remain basically as is. Make testing more efficient.

*** Can have a flexible number of axis. 

**** However that number is fixed by the rule store (via the parser).

**** Otherwise similar to what we had

*** Comparison of Dynamic Constraints

**** DONE We need a parser to parse constraints from strings. This is specific to the rule store.

**** TODO Value list for 

**** DONE Equality of constraints. This is a method of constraints.
     
**** TODO Have a priority order to compare against. This can be done globally, i.e., each 

***** Parser order can be different from priority order!

***** Reference constraint is the global dynamic constraint

      Example: mathspeak.brief  < mathspeak.default if

***** Compare method for ordering with respect to the global constraint.
      What flexibility do we allow for ordering? Is a simple order list of axis/attributes enough?
      Or an order list per axis.

***** Match method to determine if we have a rule that is to be considered.
      Allow sets of axis. 
      Example: mathspeak, [default, brief]

***** DO WE STILL WANT THE DEFAULT AS BOTTOM LINE?


** Changes for Static constraints:

*** Query vs boolean constraints
    
*** Query should be simplified, when possible, i.e. self::NAME

**** Markup as different forms

***** If query is of the form self::TAGNAME 
       Mark as 'tag' and test with node.tagname
       Take care of self::*!
       Take care of namespaces (e.g., self::mathml:math)

***** If query is of the form @attr
      Mark as 'attr' and test with hasAttribute.
      
***** If query is of the form @attr="something"
      Mark as 'attrEQ' and test with hasAttribute & getAttribute= 

***** If query is of the form @attr!="something"
      Mark as 'attrNEQ' and test with !hasAttribute || getAttribute!=

***** Test speed of the above against XPATH first!


**** Other speedup potential

***** count(children/*)=n

***** Usage of Xpath in postconditions

*** Inspect and mark constraints when sorting into Trie. Maybe annotate Trie node?


*** Ordering

**** Currently only by number. 

**** Is there a better way? 
     Priorities?
     Explicit ordering by name? Can be problematic as there can be multiple
     rules with the same name.
     If done by name, we could have an explicit order definition statement in a
     rule store that would need to be collected and applied by a comparator.

**** Again ordering is independent of the Trie

** Changes to constraints of simple store elements

*** Special constraints: For single string elements

*** They only work on text nodes. 

*** Rewriting application tests:

**** recognise the query self::text() and combine with boolean query.

**** Immediately do this when sorting into Trie

**** Stop building a "rule" query and instead have trie subtype that specialised on simple stores.

*** Again test speed trade-off!

** Dynamic Constraints vs Property Test Sets

*** What do we mean by this: Dynamic constraints are "fixed" to a rule. 
    They are the one that are tested against the properties chosen by the user.
    
*** Property sets are values for dynamic constraints that can be selected by the user.
    Dynamic constraints are then tested against that set.
    
*** Fallbacks are dynamic constraints that a rule set can use to control, if defaults

**** This could get us tighter control, how we deal with fallbacks.

**** We could completely get rid of the "default" fallback and always force explicit fallback definition.

**** How does that work together with the strict setting?

***** When do we use strict?

***** If it is only used on particular sets, then they should not define fallbacks.

***** Simply do not use fallbacks when in strict mode.

** TODO Make rule definition robust against errors!

* Trie design ideas:

** Usage

*** Have one trie per rule store or per domain?

**** One trie per rule store. They get the query and constraint function as static function.

**** They get string matching with respect to axes for the dynamic constraints.

**** add/delete/findRule are being run on the Trie.

*** When combining rule sets, combine tries or rather search through list of tries?
   The former is probably too expensive and also might not make sense when swapping rule sets regularly.
   Is that a use case? How often would we swap rule sets?

*** What about the simple rule stores? Should we simply go back to using the dictionary lookup?

** Design

*** Trie starting with dynamic constraint? Yes

*** Trie starting with query? No

*** Combine rule stores are to be replaced by a combined trie

** DataStructure

*** Node with

**** Type (root, dynamic, query, boolean, rule = leaf?)


***** We should probably have a class per node type.
      
**** Leaf or Rule nodes are not necessary. Instead we have a abstract class of constraint nodes. 
     They can have a single rule come off.

**** SubType (string)

***** Dynamic: The axis name

***** Static: the form or xpath

***** Rule: name

**** The actual content (string)

***** Dynamic: value of axis

***** Static: xpath expression

***** Rule: postcondition or full rule object

**** Auxiliary content (static only) (string)

***** The comparison string or empty if none is necessary.

*** Should every node bring their own test? Or select test according to type? 
    Probably better the former, but has to be a static function! 
    Should be assigned during sub-type computation.
    For dynamic computation that will be a bit problematic!
    Dynamic match needs to use the global comparator.

*** Children implemented as Object.<string, node> where the string is the actual content.

*** Lookup of rules

**** Two types: Dynamic Constraint, Static Constraint

**** For dynamic constraints: Use order, test each constraint against a list of constraints. 
     E.g., [short, default].

***** Child node is accepted, if it is a dynamic node and constraint is member of given constraint list

***** or if it is a static node. 
      This means we have a node that has a shorter dynamic constraint spec. 
      These can be used as defaults.

**** For static constraints: 

***** Child nodes is accepted, if the test returns true.

**** Collecting rules along the valid paths in the trie:

***** If a matching (static) node contains a rule, it is collected.

*** Depth and balancing might be interesting.
    We could effectively invert order of dynamic and static constraints. Not sure if that makes any sense.
    
    No, it does not. Better have some clever way of checking on the query
    level. That is the bottle neck. E.g. try to only have tagname checks there (and *)
    

* Symbol mappings

** Could be done with a trie. But at the moment it turns out to be more efficient to leave as is.
   See the abandoned tweak_simple_stores branch for a failed attempt.

** Maybe change mappings to contain entire dynamic constraints as they will get unwieldy with more axis.

** Give them a standard order: i.e., keep default, style: short>default

* Grammar structure

** General idea

*** Grammar elements are added and removed via personality annotations.

*** Keywords are mapped to either a string or a boolean.

*** XML element gets special grammar attribute with space separated list of keywords and strings, or boolean.
    
*** This way we can check in the rules if a grammatical case is applicable.

**** This only works for the next level. Needs to be repeated, if necessary.
     
**** Alternative, always propagate the grammar attribute.

*** Should work both for [n] and [m] nodes.

** To subsume preprocess, correction, remove, sre_flag, font/hiddenfont, annotation:unit
   Got rid of font, sre_flag, remove.

** Singleton structure similar to global parameters

*** Holds mappings of grammar keywords to either strings or booleans.

*** Equipped with mappings to correction functions for certain grammar keywords.

** Dispatch in extra grammar keyword in personality annotations.

*** Test with determinant simple and hidden fonts.

*** New grammar syntax in personality annotations:

**** grammar:aa:bb="something":cc=@font:dd=CSFsomething:!ee
     Note the overall separator is : as not to conflict with separators between
     personality annotations.

***** Adds boolean aa

***** Adds bb with value something

***** Adds cc with font name of the current node

***** Adds dd with string computed by CSFsomething

***** Removes ee 

*** We might want to have special function for grammar checking instead of the grammar attribute
    Check after integration with the Trie (WP1.3)
