\title{Speech Rule Engine:\\ Semantic Tree Grammar}
\author{Volker Sorge}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Sections~\ref{sec:types},~\ref{sec:roles},~\ref{sec:fonts} presents the types,
roles and fonts used in the semantic representation. Types are used as tags in
corresponding XML representation, while roles and fonts are attributes.

\section{Types}
\label{sec:types}

Types are immutable. Their idea is to capture the basic natur of a symbol.

\subsection{Primitive Types}
\label{sec:primitive types}

They are assigned by default to single symbols (or combination in the case of
numbers, functions, units) and never change.

\begin{tabular}{>{\tt}ll}
  punctuation & Punctuation like comma, dot, ellipses.\\
  fence & Fence symbol.\\
  number & One or several digits, plus some punctuation.\\
  identifier & Single or multiple letters.\\
  text & Regular text in a math expression.\\
  operator & e.g. $+, *$.\\
  relation & Relation symbol, e.g. equals.\\
  largeop & e.g. Sum, product, integral.\\
  function & Some named function.\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Compound Types}
\label{sec:compound types}

They are computed once and then never change.

\end{tabular}

\section{Roles}
\label{sec:roles}

Roles are mutable. They describe the role of a symbol in the context of the
formula. Initially a symbol is assigned a default role, which can change during
the course of the semantic interpretation.  Therefore some roles simply mirror
the type, usually until something more specific is known about the role of this
particular symbol. As example consider $f$ in the expression $f(x)$. It gets
assigned type \texttt{identifier} and role \texttt{latinletter}. However, the
role will eventually change to \texttt{prefix function}.

\subsection{Symbol Roles}
\label{sec:symbol-roles}

              & dash & dash characters of differing length.\\
              & ellipsis & unicode ellipses characters. Does not include sequences of separate full stops.\\
              & fullstop & single period characters.\\
              & prime & prime characters (includes multiple primes)\\
              & openfence & an open fence, which is not used as a fence, i.e., it is solitary
                            and has no counterpart. It is thus considered a punctuation element.\\
              & closefence & ditto for closed fence.\\
              & vbar & ditto for neutral fence.\\
              & dummy & usage of invisible comma as the dummy separator for text.\\

              & otherletter & Character from some other alphabet. Currently Hebrew.\\
              & unit & A unit name. Normally comes from \mathml{MathML-Unit} class attribute.\\
              & unknown & a designated identifier (\mathml{mi}) that we could not be classified any
                          further. Usually multi character identifier.\\

              & mixed & An integer with a vulgar fraction and an implicit
                        multiplication between the two.\\
         & latinletter & single character that has been explicitly designated as number by \mathml{mn}.\\
         & greekletter & ditto.\\
         & otherletter & ditto. \\

\end{tabular}


\subsection{Roles for Compound Types}

% \begin{tabular}{>{\tt}l>{\tt}lp{11cm}}
% \end{tabular}

\paragraph{Roles for type \texttt{unit}: }

When a term has been identified as type \texttt{unit} it is also assigned the
same role. This can be propagated to more complex structures, in particular, of
type \texttt{infixop} with multiplication and \texttt{fraction}.


\subsection{Tables, Vectors, Matrices}

Unless some special case can be identified the role will be unknown.

\begin{tabular}{>{\tt}l>{\tt}lp{11cm}}
  Type & Role & Meaning\\\hline
  vector & binomial & Vector with exactly two line elements.\\
       & squarematrix & Vector with exactly one element.\\
       & determinant & Vector with exactly one element and neutral fences.\\
  matrix & rowvector & A single row with multiple cells. Normally a vector has line elements,
                       this one has rows and cells, hence is classified as a matrix.\\
       & squarematrix & Matrix with the number of rows and columns.\\
       & determinant & Square matrix with neutral fences.\\
\end{tabular}
Observe that both vectors and matrices can be determinants or square
matrices. The type then determines what components they contain, either lines or
rows and cells.

In general components of tabular expressions, i.e., lines, rows, cells, get the
same role as the type of the expression. In the particular case, where a tabular
element has a specialist role, they inherit that role instead.

\section{Fonts}
\label{sec:fonts}

Some symbols also have a font element attached. Font elements can be extended to
entire expressions if they all share a common font. Font values are:\vspace*{.5cm}

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{>{\tt}l}
  bold\\
  bold-fraktur\\
  bold-italic\\
  bold-script
\end{tabular}\quad
\begin{tabular}{>{\tt}l}
  double-struck\\
  double-struck-italic\\
  fraktur\\
  italic\\
\end{tabular}\quad
\begin{tabular}{>{\tt}l}
  monospace\\
  normal\\
  script\\
  sans-serif\\
\end{tabular}\quad
\begin{tabular}{>{\tt}l}
  sans-serif-italic\\
  sans-serif-bold\\
  sans-serif-bold-italic\\
  unknown
\end{tabular}

\section{Branching Nodes Overview}
\label{sec:branching-nodes-overview}

Branch nodes have both children and content. 

Node types containing no content are: 

root, sqrt, table, row, cell, enclose, number (with role mixed), subscript,
superscript, underscore, overscore, bigop, integral, fraction, tensor

Node types containing content: 

infix, prefix, postfix, relseq, multirel, fenced, punctuated, appl

\subsection{Nodes without content}

These are usually quite straightforward and often mirror the corresponding
MathML element. There are some exception however: 

Number only with role mixed, where the two children are an integer and a vulgar
fraction.

Bigop consists of big operator and it's arguments. E.g. $\sum f(x) + b$ would
yield a big operator with children $\sum, f(x)$. $+ b$ would be considered not
to be part of the sum.

Integral always has three children: Integral symbol, Integrand and Integral
variable. Note that the last two can be both empty. This allows for $\int$,
$\int dx$, and $\int f$.

Tensor is similar to mmultiscripts but contains always all four indices.  Some
might of course be empty.

\subsection{Nodes with content}


\noindent
\begin{tabular}{l||p{3.5cm}|p{3.5cm}|l||r@{$\quad\longrightarrow\quad$}l}
  Type & Content & Children & Mixed Element & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Example}\\\hline
  infixop & Operators & Operands & unique operator & $a+b+c$ &  [+, +][a, b, c] ``+" \\
  prefixop & Operators & Operand & concatenated ops & $++a$ & [+, +][a]``++" \\ 
  postfixop & Operators & Operand & concatenated ops & $a--$ & [-, -][a]``--" \\ 
  relseq & Relations & Operands & unique relation & $a=b=c$ & [=, =][a,b,c]``=" \\ 
  multirel & Relations & Operands & None & $a=b<c$ & [=, $<$][a,b,c] \\ 
  fenced & Fences & Content & None & $(a + c)$ & [(,)][a+c]\\
  punctuated & Punctuations & Full content & None & $a;b;c$ & [;,;][a,b,c]\\
  appl & Appl function, function symbol & Function, arguments & None & $f(x)$ & [@, f][f, (x)]\\ 
  bigop & large op symbol & operator, arguments & None & $\sum_{i=0}{n} i$ & [$\sum$, f][$\sum_{i=0}{n}$, i]\\ 
  integral & integral symbol & integral, integrand, variable & None & $\int_{0}{n}x\, dx$ & [($\int$, f][$\int_{0}{n}$, x, dx]\\
  matrix & Fences & Table & None & $(a)$ & [$(,)$][$a$]\\
  vector & Fences & Lines & None & $(a)$ & [$(,)$][$a$]\\
  cases & Opening Fence & Lines or Table & None & $\{a$ & [$\{$][$a$]\\
\end{tabular}


Interesting special cases are implicit infix operators, separated text, and
function applications as they introduce elements that do not exist in the
original MathML expression. The latter is already given in the table above. The
former two correspond to the following two cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A sequence of separated identifiers is translated into an infixop with
  role implicit, where the operator is the invisible times. The operator is
  added as the mixed element but only once to the content. Moreover, it does not
  correspond to an existing MathML element.
\item A sequence dominated by mtext elements is translated into a punctuated
  list with role text, where the punctuation is the invisible comma. Similar to
  the previous case the invisible comma is added as mixed element but only once
  to the content.
\end{enumerate}
